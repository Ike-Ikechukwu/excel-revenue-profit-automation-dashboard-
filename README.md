# Excel Revenue & Profit Automation Dashboard
excel automation dashboard for revenue and profit analysis using Power Query, Pivot Tables, and light VBA.
**Nigeria Retail and E-commerce Transactional Data**

## Overview
This project is an **Excel-based automated dashboard** for analyzing **revenue and profit** from the *Nigeria Retail and E-commerce Transactional Data*.
It automates data cleaning, consolidation, and reporting, and allows users to toggle between **Revenue** and **Profit** views using light VBA.

## Problem
Monthly sales data often comes as seperate CSV files that require repeated manual cleaning, consolidation and analysis to track revenue and profit.
This slows reporting and increases the chance of errors, making it difficult for decision-makers to get timely insights.

The challenge is to create an **Excel-based solution** that **automates monthly revenue and profit analysis**, refreshes insight with minimal effort and presents results through a clear, decision-ready dashboard.

## Solution
An Excel-based automation dashboard was developed to streamline monthly revenue and profit analysis. The solution automatically consolidates transactional data, standardizes it for consistent reporting, and presents key performance metrics through an interactive dashboard.
With a single refresh, the latest available data is automatically included in the analysis, updating revenue, profit, and margin insights end-to-end without repeated manual work. The design priortizes minimal manual effort, repeatable monthly analysis, and clear business insights, while using light interactivity to allow users to switch between revenue and profit views as needed.
